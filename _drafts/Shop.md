**Blueprints** allow players to purchase new [Appliances](https://wiki.plateupgame.com/appliances), [Ingredients](https://wiki.plateupgame.com/ingredients), and [Decorations](https://wiki.plateupgame.com/Decorations) for the restaurant using ![Coins](https://wiki.plateupgame.com/icons/coin.png) coins.

Typically, **five** blueprints will appear as envelopes at the start of each Prepration Phase, and can be opened using Grab (this number varies on decoration days, and with the [Blueprint Desk](https://wiki.plateupgame.com/gameplay/Blueprints#blueprint-desk)). Walking over a blueprint provides a full description of its corresponding item, which may be purchased by holding Interact.

Each blueprint displays icons depending on its properties.

- ![Copy](https://wiki.plateupgame.com/icons/copy.png) This blueprint has been **copied** using a [Copying Desk](https://wiki.plateupgame.com/appliances/CopyingDesk). It cannot be copied further, but may be upgraded, discounted, or rerolled.
- ![Upgrade](https://wiki.plateupgame.com/icons/upgrade.png) This blueprint can be **upgraded** using a [Research Desk](https://wiki.plateupgame.com/appliances/ResearchDesk).
- ![Coins](https://wiki.plateupgame.com/icons/coin.png) This blueprint must be **purchased**. If players have insufficient ![Coins](https://wiki.plateupgame.com/icons/coin.png) coins, this icon will be **red**.



Players can also Grab a blueprint and place it into a [Blueprint Cabinet](https://wiki.plateupgame.com/appliances/BlueprintCabinet). Blueprints stored in this way are protected, since any left on the floor when leaving the Preparation Phase will be lost (if Practice Mode is activated, loose blueprints will disappear temporarily, but reappear upon exiting).

The type and quality of Blueprints available to players can be manipulated through **upgrading** (see [Research](https://wiki.plateupgame.com/gameplay/Research) for upgrade mechanics, and [Upgrade Tree](https://wiki.plateupgame.com/appliances/UpgradeTree) for a list of upgrades), as well as with the Blueprint Desk and rerolls.

# Shop

The **Shop** refers to the selection of blueprints which appear in envelopes at the start of the Preparation Phase. These are randomly chosen from predetermined item sets known as Pools, the contents of which change as players acquire certain items and [Cards](https://wiki.plateupgame.com/Cards) (see sections on individual pools for more).

On a **typical day** *(all except Day 1 and decoration days)*...

- **4** blueprints are chosen from the **[Staple Pool](https://wiki.plateupgame.com/gameplay/Blueprints#staple-pool)**. This number decreases by **1** every fifth day, down to a minimum of **2**.
- **All other** blueprints are chosen from the **[Seed Pool](https://wiki.plateupgame.com/gameplay/Blueprints#seed-pool)**. The chance for a blueprint to be **upgraded** increases by **10%** every fifth day, starting at **0%**.



On a ![Copy](https://wiki.plateupgame.com/icons/franchise.png)![Copy](https://wiki.plateupgame.com/icons/decoration.png) **decoration day** *(Day 6 and every subsequent fifth day)*...

- **8** blueprints are chosen from [**Decorations**](https://wiki.plateupgame.com/Decorations), either miscellaneous or matching the chosen theme.
- Additionally, **3** wallpapers and **3** sets of flooring are chosen (these are not blueprints and cannot be stored or rerolled).



On **Day 1** *(upon starting a new run)* there is no usual shop, but players may still be offered...

- **1 [Booking Desk](https://wiki.plateupgame.com/appliances/BookingDesk)** blueprint (must be unlocked, and "Booking Desk as parcel" must be disabled in Options > Game).
- Any blueprints granted by ![img](https://wiki.plateupgame.com/cards/card_icon_franchise_1.png) **[Franchise Cards](https://wiki.plateupgame.com/Cards#franchise-cards)** for free starting items (Bootstrapping, Grabber, Wash Basin).



Guaranteeing blueprints for the following day using the [Blueprint Desk](https://wiki.plateupgame.com/gameplay/Blueprints#blueprint-desk) will override the usual formula. This makes it possible for non-decoration blueprints to appear in the shop on decoration days.

# Reroll

**Rerolling** allows players to exchange all blueprints (excluding those stored in [Blueprint Cabinets](https://wiki.plateupgame.com/appliances/BlueprintCabinet)) for a new, randomly chosen selection.

Reroll is activated by holding Interact on the dice outside the restaurant during the Preparation Phase. This initially costs 10 ![Coins](https://wiki.plateupgame.com/icons/coin.png) coins, and its cost increases by 10 ![Coins](https://wiki.plateupgame.com/icons/coin.png) coins with each activation for the remainder of the run.

Like the shop, blueprints produced by a reroll follow certain conditions.

- **All** blueprints are chosen from the **[Seed Pool](https://wiki.plateupgame.com/gameplay/Blueprints#seed-pool)**. Staple and Non-droppable items will never appear.
- From **Day 7** onwards, there is a small chance for **upgraded** appliances to appear.
- On a **typical day**, only non-decoration items ([Appliances](https://wiki.plateupgame.com/appliances) and [Ingredients](https://wiki.plateupgame.com/ingredients)) will appear.
- On a ![Copy](https://wiki.plateupgame.com/icons/franchise.png)![Copy](https://wiki.plateupgame.com/icons/decoration.png) **decoration day**, only [Decorations](https://wiki.plateupgame.com/Decorations) will appear, either miscellanous or matching the chosen theme.



Players may add to the blueprints offered by the shop for that day by removing and placing down others from Blueprint Cabinets (including ![Copy](https://wiki.plateupgame.com/icons/copy.png) copies produced by a [Copying Desk](https://wiki.plateupgame.com/appliances/CopyingDesk)), allowing for much larger rerolls. In multiplayer, having players hold blueprints will not prevent them from being rerolled.

# Blueprint Desk

![Copy](https://wiki.plateupgame.com/appliances/blueprintdesk.png)

  *Further information: [Blueprint Desk](https://wiki.plateupgame.com/appliances/BlueprintDesk)*

The **Blueprint Desk** allows players to guarantee that a single copy of the chosen blueprint will appear in the shop at the start of the following day.

Upon leaving Preparation Mode, each Blueprint Desk in the restaurant will begin to cycle at random intervals through blueprints for non-upgraded [Appliances](https://wiki.plateupgame.com/appliances) and [Ingredients](https://wiki.plateupgame.com/ingredients). Pressing Interact on a desk will display a green tick and lock in the current blueprint for the rest of the day. Any Blueprint Desks still active at closing time (when the bar at the top of the screen is full) will automatically lock in their current blueprint.

On a **typical day**, multiple Blueprint Desks can override the usual shop selection for **all but 1** blueprint, which will always be chosen from the [Staple Pool](https://wiki.plateupgame.com/gameplay/Blueprints#staple-pool). Beyond this, the number of blueprints offered by the shop will increase to accommodate any additional blueprints locked in the previous day.

- **Example 1  |  2 Blueprint Desks  |  Typical Day** *(shop normally offers **5** blueprints)*
  **3** blueprints will be chosen as usual from the Staple and Seed Pools, and **2** will be those guaranteed by the desks, for a total of **5**.
- **Example 2  |  10 Blueprint Desks  |  Typical Day** *(shop normally offers **5** blueprints)*
  **1** blueprint will be chosen from the Staple Pool, and **10** will be those guaranteed by the desks, for a total of **11**.



On a ![Copy](https://wiki.plateupgame.com/icons/franchise.png)![Copy](https://wiki.plateupgame.com/icons/decoration.png) **decoration day**, blueprints are granted from Blueprint Desks in addition to **all 8** usual [Decoration](https://wiki.plateupgame.com/Decorations) blueprints.

- **Example 3  |  10 Blueprint Desks  |  Decoration Day** *(shop normally offers **8** blueprints)*
  **8** blueprints will be chosen from Decorations, and **10** will be those guaranteed by the desks, for a total of **18**.



The Blueprint Desk will never offer [Appliances](https://wiki.plateupgame.com/appliances) and [Ingredients](https://wiki.plateupgame.com/ingredients) currently belonging to the **[Non-droppable Pool](https://wiki.plateupgame.com/gameplay/Blueprints#non-droppable-pool)**, with the exception of the [Coffee Machine](https://wiki.plateupgame.com/recipes/StartersSidesDesserts#desserts). After taking the ![img](https://wiki.plateupgame.com/cards/card_icon_starterssidesdesserts_1.png) **Black Coffee** Card, the Coffee Machine can be offered by a Blueprint Desk, despite never being produced by the shop or a reroll.

# Pools

**Pools** are the different item sets from which blueprints are randomly chosen for the shop, rerolls, and [Blueprint Desk](https://wiki.plateupgame.com/gameplay/Blueprints#blueprint-desk) (the selection process for each is described in their respective sections). Items may shift between pools over the course of the run, depending on the active [Cards](https://wiki.plateupgame.com/Cards) and appliances currently present in the restaurant.



## Staple Pool



| **Permanent**                                                | **Conditional**                                              |                                                              |                                                              |                                                              |                                                              |                                                              |

The **Staple Pool** consists of essential appliances for a functioning restaurant. Staples are the most common blueprints to be offered by the shop at the start of a new run.

The contents of this pool can change over the course of a run.

- The **[Research Desk](https://wiki.plateupgame.com/appliances/ResearchDesk)** is **removed** from the Staple to the Seed Pool so long as one is present in the restaurant.
- The **[Blueprint Cabinet](https://wiki.plateupgame.com/appliances/BlueprintCabinet)** is **removed** from the Staple to the Seed Pool so long as one is present in the restaurant (this includes the Cabinet provided at the start of a run).
- Items offered more regularly as a result of ![img](https://wiki.plateupgame.com/cards/card_icon_franchise_1.png) **[Franchise Cards](https://wiki.plateupgame.com/Cards#franchise-cards)** are **added** to the Staple from the Seed Pool for the entire run.



Items from the Staple Pool will never be produced by a reroll.



## Seed Pool

The **Seed Pool** is determined by the current seed (or *map*), and contains items that do not fall within the Staple or Non-droppable Pools. All blueprints for rerolls, and some for the shop and [Blueprint Desk](https://wiki.plateupgame.com/appliances/BlueprintDesk), are chosen from this pool.

When replaying the same seed or reloading the same day, the shop will always produce the same blueprints, provided that all other variables remain consistent. However, if different items are transferred between the Staple or Non-droppable Pools and the Seed Pool on runs of the same seed (as a result of chosen [Food Cards](https://wiki.plateupgame.com/Cards#food-cards), or the presence or absence of a [Research Desk](https://wiki.plateupgame.com/appliances/ResearchDesk) and [Blueprint Cabinet](https://wiki.plateupgame.com/appliances/BlueprintCabinet)), the shop may produce different blueprints, depending upon the contents of the Seed Pool for the current run.



## Non-droppable Pool

The **Non-droppable Pool** mostly consists of [Ingredients and Equipment](https://wiki.plateupgame.com/ingredients) not currently required by the restaurant.

Blueprints for Non-droppable items will never be produced by the shop, a reroll, or the Blueprint Desk until players choose a [Food Card](https://wiki.plateupgame.com/Cards#food-cards) which requires new Ingredients or Equipment. At this point, the relevant items are transferred to the **Seed Pool**.

There are some exceptions to this rule.

- **[Burger Patty](https://wiki.plateupgame.com/ingredients/BurgerPatty)** will always belong to the Non-droppable Pool.
- **[Coffee Machine](https://wiki.plateupgame.com/recipes/StartersSidesDesserts#desserts)** will only be offered by the [Blueprint Desk](https://wiki.plateupgame.com/appliances/BlueprintDesk) (never the shop or a reroll) once the ![img](https://wiki.plateupgame.com/cards/card_icon_starterssidesdesserts_1.png) **Black Coffee** Card is acquired.
- **[Fish](https://wiki.plateupgame.com/ingredients)** providers will never appear as blueprints, even with a relevant Recipe. They are instead acquired through the ![img](https://wiki.plateupgame.com/cards/card_icon_extras_1.png) **Fish Selection** Card.



# Tips

- In the first few days of a new run, the [Research Desk](https://wiki.plateupgame.com/appliances/ResearchDesk) will remain in the Staple Pool until one is purchased. With this in mind, players can store the first Research Desk blueprint produced by the shop in a [Blueprint Cabinet](https://wiki.plateupgame.com/appliances/BlueprintCabinet), then wait for another copy to appear in the coming days. Since early shops offer Staples far more commonly than other items, players can quickly secure two Research Desks, using one to upgrade the other to another desk of their choosing (see section on [Staple Pool](https://wiki.plateupgame.com/gameplay/Blueprints#staple-pool) for more on mechanics involved).
- When rerolling, players may wish to maximise their blueprints in order to see as many potential options as possible. This can be done by preparing a [Copying Desk](https://wiki.plateupgame.com/appliances/CopyingDesk) and several Blueprint Cabinets on the previous day, which will grant multiple copied blueprints for the sole purpose of rerolling. A slower and more difficult method involves the use of several Blueprint Desks, since if the number of desks exceeds the number of blueprints offered by the shop, it will be forced to produce additional copies (see section on [Blueprint Desk](https://wiki.plateupgame.com/gameplay/Blueprints#blueprint-desk) for more on mechanics involved).
